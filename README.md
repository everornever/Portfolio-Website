# React Test Website
It is not my main website and was only a small project I did for university.
It was build using Firebase as a database for the user login, React as a base for the website and every components where wirtten in CSS manuely.


## Packages:

**NPM Packages:**
- react
- react-router-dom
- firebase --save

# Login
The login page is the entry point for the website.
In the backend the user is checked via a Firebase Auth.
I created a dummy account to log in.
The page is fully responsive and has a small login animation.

**Login-Daten:**

**Email:** test@mail.com

**Passwort:** passwort

# Website
The website was built entirely with React and React Route DOM and designed with vanilla CSS.
There are several sections like #About or #Skills.
The site is responsive in 3 levels (Large, Med, small). The navigation bar also adapts and moves down in mobile.
A darkmode can be used and adjusts all colors. (Unfortunately buggy, therefore deactivated)
